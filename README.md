### Hi, I'm Marc 👋🏻

I'm interested in environmental markets and all things [Web3][6]. I enjoy working on challenges related to GHG Accounting & the Global Energy Transition. You can find out more about me on my personal site [here][1].

## 👨🏼‍💻 Active Side-Projects

I'm currently working on <a href="https://unios.world/" target="_blank">Unios World</a>, a generative NFT project that creates personal connections with nature and technology in the physical and virtual worlds. 

I'm also working on a scope 3 emissions application called <a href="https://github.com/mjohnson518/Carbon12" target="_blank">Carbon12</a>. The aim of the project is to leverage the web3 tech stack to showcase how we can track and trace embodied emissions through industrial supply chains. 

Lastly, I still maintain <a href="https://ndcportal.app/" target="_blank">NDC Portal</a>, a Django web-app thats intended to provide interested parties with the information needed to analyze the similarities and differences between [Nationally Determined Contributions][5].

## :bread: Second Breakfast

You can find my blog posts on [Second Breakfast][3]. I usually write about energy, finance, tech, sustainability, and geopolitics. My knowledge is high-level & superficial in all of these topics, but little pieces of insight help me navigate the world.
